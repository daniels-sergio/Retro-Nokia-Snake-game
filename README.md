# Retro-Nokia-Snake-game
My recreation of the Snake game that was on the older generations Nokia phones. The game is fully created with the turtle library which is really versatile and is extremely helpful for project based learning




Instructions

run the main.py file to play the game

wasd keys to control the direction of the snake

spacebar to pause and unpause game

try to avoid collsions with walls and the snakes tail


Note

There is a bug whereby if the player clicks multiple control keys simulatanesly the game randomly ends as it recognises that as a collison with its tail even if the snake isnt long enough for tail based collisions. I am still trying to figure it out athough I believe its an issue with the turtle library not being able to handle simultaneous inputs graciosly.

But in the mean time enjoy playing Snake :)
